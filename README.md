# RECIPE FINDER APP

The Recipe Finder App is a web application designed to help users discover recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. The app is structured using HTML, styled with CSS and Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing interface, and powered by JavaScript to enable dynamic functionality.

The core feature of the app is its ability to fetch recipe suggestions from a third-party API. By entering a list of ingredients, users can retrieve real-time recipe options, complete with images, ingredient details, and links to full cooking instructions. This seamless integration of API fetching makes the app highly interactive and user-friendly.

## Key Features:

- Ingredient-Based Search: Users input ingredients, and the app suggests relevant recipes.
- Dynamic Recipe Display: Recipe cards with titles, images, and links are dynamically generated using JavaScript.
- Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap for a clean layout and optimal experience across devices.
- API Integration: Fetches real-time recipe data from services like Spoonacular or Edamam, ensuring updated and accurate results.
